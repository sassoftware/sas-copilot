# Overview 

The SAS Copilot Extension for Visual Studio Code is a great tool to enhance your productivity as you program in SAS. SAS Copilot uses Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to add comments to a block of SAS code, write an explanation of a block of SAS code, and generate SAS code based on a block of comments in a SAS program.

We are presently undergoing internal testing. If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please report as [issues](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-copilot/issues/new/choose)
