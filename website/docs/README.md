# Overview

The SAS Viya Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code is a tool that enhances your productivity as you program in SAS. SAS Viya Copilot uses Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to add comments to SAS code, write an explanation for existing SAS code, and generate SAS code based on instructions in comments in a SAS program.

:::note

Although SAS offers multiple coding environments, such as SAS Studio and SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Viya Copilot is currently available only as an extension for Visual Studio Code to complement the SAS Extension for Visual Studio Code.

:::

The SAS Viya Copilot is provided as a service for SAS Viya 4 environments (release 2025.05 and later). Although the Copilot service is not provided by the SAS Viya deployment itself, the SAS Viya 4 environment provides the subscription secrets that allow access to the service.
